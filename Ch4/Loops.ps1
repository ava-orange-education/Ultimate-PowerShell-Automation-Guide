# Example: For Loop
for ($i = 1; $i -le 5; $i++) {
    Write-Host "Iteration $i"
}

Let's consider another example to simulate a countdown timer using a for loop with a delay:
# Example: Simulate a Countdown Timer

function Start-Countdown {
    $durationInSeconds = 10

    for ($i = $durationInSeconds; $i -gt 0; $i--) {
        Write-Host "Time left: $i seconds"
        Start-Sleep -Seconds 1
    }

    Write-Host "Countdown completed!"
}

# Test the function
Start-Countdown
Write-Host "Task after countdown."


# Example: Foreach Loop
$fruits = @("Apple", "Banana", "Orange")
foreach ($fruit in $fruits) {
    Write-Host "Current fruit: $fruit"
}

#Code Output:
Current fruit: Apple
Current fruit: Banana
Current fruit: Orange

# Example: Perform Action for Each Employee

# List of employee names
$employees = @("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David")

# Use foreach loop to iterate over each employee
foreach ($employee in $employees) {
    Write-Host "Processing employee: $employee"
    # Add your custom action here for each employee
}

Write-Host "Processing completed for all employees."


# Example: While Loop
$counter = 1
while ($counter -le 3) {
    Write-Host "Iteration $counter"
    $counter++
}

# Example: Number Guessing Game with While Loop

# Generate a random number between 1 and 10
$correctNumber = Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 11

Write-Host "Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!"
Write-Host "Try to guess the correct number between 1 and 10."

# Initialize variables
$guessedNumber = 0

# Use a while loop until the correct number is guessed
while ($guessedNumber -ne $correctNumber) {
    # Prompt user for input
    $guessedNumber = Read-Host "Enter your guess"

    # Try to convert the input to an integer
    if ($guessedNumber -as [int]) {
        $guessedNumber = $guessedNumber -as [int]

        # Validate the range
        if ($guessedNumber -ge 1 -and $guessedNumber -le 10) {
            # Compare user's guess with the correct number
            if ($guessedNumber -eq $correctNumber) {
                Write-Host "Congratulations! You guessed the correct number: $correctNumber"
            } else {
                Write-Host "Try again. Incorrect guess."
            }
        } else {
            Write-Host "Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 10."
        }
    } else {
        Write-Host "Invalid input. Please enter a valid number."
    }
}

Write-Host "Game Over."

# Example: Do-While Loop
$counter = 1
do {
    Write-Host "Iteration $counter"
    $counter++
} while ($counter -le 3)


#: Using ForEach-Object to iterate over a collection
1..5 | ForEach-Object {
    Write-Host "Current number: $_"
}
### Output:
Current number: 1
Current number: 2
Current number: 3
Current number: 4
Current number: 5
